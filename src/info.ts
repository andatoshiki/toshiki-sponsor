üëã „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ! Hi there, I'm Anda Toshiki (ÂÆâÁî∞‰øäÊ®π), or you could call me Ki Chan (Ê®π„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì) if you are as much as a weeb like I do. I'm currently a high-shcool student who is preping for college admission with a strong intrest in the field of web development and software engineering, both command-line based or with a GUI (but usually based on my laziness or external motivations such as money, or else I would just leave my github without any updates or commits, blame my procrastination :P)
    
I'm also learning computer networking as one of the hardest concept amongst the field of computing. I love learning while taking notes while sharing my owned knoledges with other, since taiting others doing this serves while form as a large knowledge web for spreading knowledges of different field that people are usually not familiar with. Each person is a node, kinda like a WAN that spans the globe if you are familiar with networking.
    
The projects I'm working on forwith mainly targets on a fresh GUI application for Clash, named clash-t, if you are not familiar with clash at all, don't worry, head over to my GitHub and take an eye on. Aside from this, I'm also an active maintainer of toshiki-proxypool, listed below in my featured repos cards, welcome to take a glimpse. Also I'm the founder and an active contributor of toshikidev developing community on GitHub, we mostly focuses on developing interesting web based project, feel free to heaed over as well!

As you may see, this is a sponsor page not a biopage for introducing me, please support me within your financial capability, a can of monster would be great for boosting my energy while I'm sleepy that causes procrastination in updates!

(I'm cute, give me money :D)
